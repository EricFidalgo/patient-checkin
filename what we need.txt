2. Missing Logic: The "Heuristic Database"
Strategy Reference: 2.4 Phase 2 - "Maintain a curated database... Rule: IF Insurer == 'Medicare'..."

The Gap: Your current logic is too simple. You have:

Medicare = Red

UHC/Cigna = Yellow

Everything else = Green

Why it matters: This will yield "False Positives." For example, Blue Cross in Florida has completely different rules than Blue Cross in California. Your current code treats them identically.

The Fix: You need a JSON "Lookup Table" (Simulated Database) that cross-references Carrier + State.





3. Missing Deliverable: The PDF Report
Strategy Reference: 2.3 - "User Receives: A personalized Coverage Intelligence Report... Formularly Status... Estimated Copay."

The Gap: Your code displays a result card on the screen, but it does not generate a downloadable asset (PDF).

Why it matters: The Strategy positions this as a "Value Exchange." The user gave you their PHI (Protected Health Information); giving them a downloadable PDF makes the transaction feel professional and valuable, rather than just a "website popup."

The Fix: You need a "Download Official Report" button on the result card.





4. Missing Compliance: Active Encryption
Strategy Reference: 2.5 - "AES-256 Encrypted"

The Gap: You have a // TODO comment for encryption, but the data is currently sitting in plain text in the sensitiveData variable.

Why it matters: If you claim "AES-256 Encrypted" in the footer, you must actually do it before the data leaves the browser (or is stored).
